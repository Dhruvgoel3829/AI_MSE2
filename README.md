## üìò Introduction
This project classifies news articles into predefined categories: `tech`, `business`, and `sports`, using basic metadata like word count, presence of keywords, and read time. The problem involves **multi-class supervised machine learning**.

---

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Automating the classification of news articles can enhance personalization, searchability, and reduce manual sorting efforts. The goal is to create a robust ML model that categorizes articles based on structured metadata.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Develop a classification model using metadata.
- Preprocess and encode data appropriately.
- Train a Random Forest classifier.
- Evaluate with metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**.
- Visualize performance using a **confusion matrix**.

---

## üîç Methodology
- **Data**: `news_articles.csv` with 100 entries and 4 columns.
- **Preprocessing**: Label encoding for the target variable.
- **Modeling**: Split 80/20 train-test, Random Forest Classifier.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall + heatmap of confusion matrix.

---

## üßº Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values.
- Encoded labels using `LabelEncoder`.
- Selected features: `word_count`, `has_keywords`, `read_time`.

---

## ü§ñ Model Implementation
Used `RandomForestClassifier` from `scikit-learn` on selected features with default parameters. Evaluated the model and visualized predictions.

---

## üìà Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness.
- **Precision**: Correctly predicted positives.
- **Recall**: True positives captured.
- **F1 Score**: Balance of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual insight into misclassifications.

---

## üìä Results
- All metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) ‚âà **0.40**
- Confusion matrix shows category overlaps.
- Performance is limited by dataset size and basic features.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
The model demonstrates foundational ML concepts. While performance was moderate, expanding data and enhancing features can yield better results. The project gave practical experience in model building, evaluation, and visualization.

---

## üßæ Dataset
- **File**: `news_articles.csv`
